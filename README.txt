This Caroussel is highly customizable

You can change the size of the LI's and add Card inside of it
Use the class "Main" as an activation for your Card on focus
Preferably dont change teh LI's, but you can add more

Use the class on UL (LI's parent) to set the Activated card 
(M0 for middle, M-x for left,Mx for right, x beeing any number between 0 and 99)
example M-1,M0,M2,M-4

You can also change the parent of all(div class="carosel" on this case) width and hight however you want

Use the css "Change.css" for yor customizations and refrain from messing with "carousel.css"
